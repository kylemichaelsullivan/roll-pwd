					Social&nbsp;Engineering
				</span>
				. Social&nbsp;engineering is a <i>non-technical</i> method of intrusion
				that hackers use, which relies heavily on <i>human interaction</i>. This
				method often involves tricking people into violating normal security
				procedures. For example, an employee gets a message from someone
				claiming to be on the IT staff, and this imposter claims they need
				passphrases to deal with an emergency <i>quickly</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I used to feel like a terrible person when I wouldn't share my passwords
				with even close coworkers and when I'd restrict access privileges to
				prevent others from being able to view and/or modify data and scripts.
				But the more I've learned about both security and boundaries, the more
				comfortable I am with taking these precautions.
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, I strongly urge you to take the first uncomfortable step to
				not tell your coworkers and colleagues your security credentials. Then,
				I'd strongly urge you to take the second awkward step to restrict access
				privileges too.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you take these precautions, though, you and your colleagues
				should still be aware of different types of{' '}
				<a

					target='_blank'
				>
					social engineering attacks
				</a>
				. <b>Security awareness training</b> can be <i>indispensable</i> to
				minimize the likelihood of being attacked by social&nbsp;engineering
				ploys.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to shredding confidential documents and securely deleting
				such data when it's no longer needed, always being aware of one's
				surroundings, using strong passphrases that are{' '}
				<b className='uppercase'>unique</b> for all logins, and being aware of
				the following types of social engineering attacks will likely reduce the
				efficacy of the following ploys.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Baiting.</b> Baiting is when an attacker leaves an{' '}
					<i>infected physical device</i> (e.g., a USB flash drive or CD) in a
					place it is sure to be found. The finder then loads it onto his or her
					computer, unintentionally installing the malware.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Phishing.</b> Phishing is when a malicious party sends a fraudulent
					email or pop-up <i>disguised as legitimate</i>, often purporting to be
					from a trusted source. The message is meant to trick the recipient
					into installing malware or sharing personal or financial information.
					Watch for grammatical, spelling, and formatting issues—including
					electronic signature issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Pretexting.</b> Pretexting is when one party defrauds another to
					gain access to privileged data and resources (e.g., a pretexting scam
					could involve an attacker who pretends to need personal or financial
					data in order to confirm the identity of the recipient). If you're
					skeptical <i>at&nbsp;all</i>, check with your IT professional!
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Quid pro quo.</b> A quid pro quo ploy is when an attacker requests
					personal information from a party <i>in exchange for</i> something
					desirable (e.g., an attacker could request login credentials in
					exchange for a free gift).{' '}
					<b>
						Do <span className='uppercase'>not</span> do this—ever!
					</b>{' '}
					You won't get the gift, and you'll <i>probably</i> get hacked.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Spam.</b> Spam is unsolicited junk email. Flag such a message as{' '}
					<b>junk</b> in your email client. You can train your computer to
					become incredibly proficient at sorting out junk mail (without
					discarding legitimate correspondence) if you regularly identify and
					report spam.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Spear phishing.</b> Spear phishing is like phishing, but it's
					tailored for a specific individual and/or organization. In these
					cases, the attacker is likely trying to uncover confidential
					information specific to the receiving party in order to obtain
					financial data and/or trade secrets. This ploy could also be used to
					surveil an organization's electronic security and/or message receipt
					practices.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Tailgating.</b> Tailgating is when an{' '}
					<i>unauthorized&nbsp;party</i> follows an <i>authorized&nbsp;party</i>{' '}
					into an otherwise secure location, usually to steal valuable property
					or confidential information. This often involves subverting keycard
					access to a secure building or area by quickly following behind an
					authorized user and catching the door or other access mechanism before
					it closes.
					<br />
					But this ploy can occur <i>electronically</i> too—be careful! Develop
					a habit of logging out whenever you're done with something, and don't
					leave your devices (or applications on them) unlocked and/or
					unattended! Lock your doors, and protect screen savers with passwords!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<i>Social&nbsp;Engineering</i> is one of the greatest security threats
				that organizations encounter today. So, be sure to protect yourself and
				others by being aware of and by taking affirmative steps to protect
				against social&nbsp;engineering attacks.
